## Profile

<!---Profile (“snapshot” of the student: personal attributes; academic and employment
achievements; brief career; strategies to achieve compliance with NMBA guidelines).-->

My name is Nick Howson and I am currently working towards getting a Bachelor of Nursing from [Western Sydney University](http://www.westernsydney.edu.au/) with an aim to graduate in 2017. Previously I worked as a Networks and System Engineer with the [NSW Department of Education & Communities](http://www.dec.nsw.gov.au/) providing computer support to both teachers and students, providing personal development to staff as well as administrating and running the schools IT infastructure on a day to day basis. 

After working with the NSW DEC I began work as a contract IT Consultant and worked with a number of small busineses and provided home based IT services to people in Western Sydney. I was contracted to [Blue Mountains Grammar School](http://www.bmgs.nsw.edu.au/) for a year where I was asked to conduct waht would end up being a year long, multiple campus, site wide hardware survey which culminated in a written report to highlight potential problem areas within the schools IT infrastructure. 

I found myself wanting more from my career and wanted to work in the public service. I began to consider nursing as an alternative and decided to go to university as a mature age student to attain my Bachelor of Nursing and become a Registered Nurse.
